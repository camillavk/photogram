This week's challenge is to build a clone of Instagram.

We need to build it using Rails. We will need users who can post pictures, write comments on pictures and like pictures. It will need to be styled to look like the instagram website (or better).

A basic breakdown of the models;
- User
- Post
- Comment/description
- Like

Bonus if we add filters.
